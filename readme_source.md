**Remote GCP Apigee**

**Overview**

Apigee is a Google Cloud Platform GCP software product for developing and managing APIs.  The remote GCP Apigee Orchestrator allows for the remote management of Apigee certificate stores.  Inventory and Management functions are supported.

This agent implements four job types â€“ Inventory, Management Add, Create and Management Remove. Below are the steps necessary to configure this Orchestrator.


**Google Cloud Configuration**

1. Read up on Google Cloud Provider Apigee and how it works.
2. A Google Service Account is needed with the following permissions (Note: Workload Identity Management Should be used but at the time of the writing it was not available in the .net library yet)

3. The following Api Access is needed:

4. Dowload the Json Credential file as shown below:
