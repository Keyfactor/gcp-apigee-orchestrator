## Overview

The GCP Apigee Universal Orchestrator extension allows for remote management of cryptographic certificates within the GCP Apigee environment. Apigee, Google's full lifecycle API management platform, uses certificates to secure communications, both for client-facing APIs and internal services. This extension integrates with Keyfactor Command to automate tasks such as adding, removing, and inventorying certificates in Apigee keystores and truststores. By leveraging this extension, organizations can ensure their API communications remain secure and compliant with organizational and regulatory standards.

## Compatibility

This integration is compatible with Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator version  and later.
